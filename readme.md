Work Item Manager
This project implements a login page that authenticates users and allows viewing and interacting with work item data retrieved from an API.

Documentation
Login Page
The login page contains a form to enter username and password. When submitted, it makes an API call to validate the credentials. If valid, it hides the login page and shows the work items page.

Work Items Page
The work items page contains a DataTable to display a list of work items fetched from an API. Each table row opens a modal when clicked to view the details of that work item.

Technologies
HTML, CSS for layout and styling
jQuery for DOM manipulation and events
Bootstrap for responsive design and modal
DataTables library for advanced table features
Fetch API for asynchronous data retrieval
Key Functions
validateUser() handles form submission and API validation call
fetchData() retrieves work items from API
updateTable() populates table dynamically
showModal() displays item details
Logic Flow

On success, fetch data and show items page
Populate table by calling updateTable()
Click rows to view details in modal
Separate concerns into logical units
Purpose
